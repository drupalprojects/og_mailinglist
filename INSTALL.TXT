OG Mailinglist - Turns Drupal into a multi-group email list.
                

OG Mailinglist allows users to start new posts by email and post comments on existing discussions by simply replying to emails.  You get the best of both worlds: a browser-based discussion site and an email-based list.

See the README.TXT file for more information on the module.


REQUIREMENTS

* A Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) - This module plugs directly into your MTA so emails can be handled immediately upon receipt.  Most modules use POP mailboxes, and while this adds portability, it adds a delay to the system.  With the method this modules uses, the MTA triggers the module as part of its normal email delivery process.
Right now the only fully supported MTA is Exim. If you use another MTA, look in the issue queue for issues on other MTAs and offer help. Soon I'd like all MTAs to be supported.

* Organic Groups - This module assumes you are using a group-oriented web site.  This module allows for a list-per-group.

* PHPMailer 5

* PHP libraries Mailparse and mimeDecode

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

* Unpack the og_mailinglist files into a subdirectory in the Drupal modules/ directory.  This is the same as installing any other Drupal module (see the Drupal manual for more information on general module installation).

* Download the latest PHPMailer 5.x to modules/og_mailinglist/PHPMailer or to libraries/PHPMailer if you use the libraries module - http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmailer/files/phpmailer%20for%20php5_6/ 

* Install the PHP library mimeDecode. On Debian/Ubuntu run from the command line, "apt-get install php-mail-mimedecode". You can also download the file directly from http://pear.php.net/package/Mail_mimeDecode and add the file either as a subdirectory to og_mailinglist or to the libraries folder. Note, mimeDecode depends on PHP PEAR, which sould be installed on any recent install of PHP but if you get weird errors, this might be something worth checking.

* Go to the Modules page in Drupal and enable the module (like normal).  After saving, navigate to admin/og_mailinglist and configure per your server setup.

* To setup og_mailinglist for incoming email, follow the installation instructions for your Mail Transfer Agent in the INSTALL.txt file found in its subdirectory (e.g. exim_og_mailinglist). For now, OG Mailinglist only works with Exim.

* To hide quoted parts of email messages, enable the provided input filter "Hide quoted text from comments created via email" at admin/settings/filter and rearrange the filters to set this one first.
  
* Congratulations.  You're running og_mailinglist!
