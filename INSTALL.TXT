OG Mailinglist - Turns Drupal into a multi-group email list.
                

OG Mailinglist allows users to start new discussions by email and post comments on existing discussions by simply replying to emails.  You get the best of both worlds: a browser-based discussion site and an email-based list.

See the README.TXT file for more information on the module.


PREREQUISITES:

* Exim 4 - This module plugs directly into Exim so emails can be handled immediately upon receipt.  Most modules use POP mailboxes, and while this adds portability, it adds a delay to the system.  With the method this modules uses, Exim triggers the module as part of its normal email delivery process.

* Organic Groups - This module assumes you are using a group-oriented web site.  This essentially allows for a list-per-group.

* Spaces / Purl (these dependecies will be refactored away in a future release).

* PHPMailer 5

* PHP libraries Mailparse and mimeDecode

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

* Unpack the og_mailinglist files into a subdirectory in the Drupal modules/ directory.  This is the same as installing any other Drupal module (see the Drupal manual for more information on general module installation).

* Download the latest PHPMailer 5.x to modules/og_mailinglist/phpmailer - http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmailer/files/phpmailer%20for%20php5_6/

* Install two PHP libraries, Mailparser and mimeDecode. On Debian/Ubuntu run from the command line, "pecl install mailparse; echo "extension=mailparse.so" >> /etc/php5/cli/php.ini; /etc/init.d/apache2 restart" and "apt-get install php-mail-mimedecode"

* Go to the Modules page in Drupal and enable the module (like normal).  After saving, navigate to admin/og_mailinglist and configure per your server setup.

* Follow the installation instructions for your MTA in the INSTALL.txt file found in its subdirectory. For now, OG Mailinglist only works with Exim.
  
* Open a terminal and go to the og_mailinglist/ directory.  Use the following commands to test your configuration:
TODO: Add testing instructions. This has changed significantly recently.
  
* Congratulations.  You're running.
